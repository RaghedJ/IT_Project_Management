Project for the IT Project Management Course. We implemented and managed the
project by applying what we learned to several milestone tasks, as an example of the
tasks included in defining the project goal, stakeholder register, stakeholder management
strategy, kick-off meeting, project charter, work breakdown structure, WBS dictionary,
gantt chart, project cost estimate, and list of prioritized risks.
